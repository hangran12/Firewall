The Firewall class implements a system with a set of predetermined security
rules which could be used to determine which network traffic should be 
allowed and which should be blocked. 

I tested my solution by using different combinations of network packets,
some of which worked and some did not. Included is a text file with 
>1,000,000 rows for testing purposes. 

I spent about 90 minutes coming up with my solution to the project so my 
work was cut a bit short, but if I had more time I would absolutely go
through my class functions in the Firewall class in order to make sure 
that the code is more readable, the logic is sound, and that the solution
has an optimized time solution. I would also potentially implement classes 
for IP, Port, and maybe Direction and Protocol in order to keep those 
classes separate from one another for a more object-oriented solution.

I would definitely be interested in any of the teams for this summer, though
I am probably most interested in Platform, then Data, then Policy. I look forward
to hearing back soon!
